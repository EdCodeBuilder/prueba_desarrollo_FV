# Excel Transformer

This Odoo module allows you to transform Excel files according to user-defined transformation rules. The module uses the Python Pandas library to read and write Excel files, and allows you to define transformation rules for each column of the file. Transformation rules can be either numeric or alphanumeric, and specify the size of each transformed field. The module also removes the comma from the generated CSV file and adds the Content-Disposition header to the output file.
